## ðŸ§  Overview

CABLD is a data-efficient self-supervised deep learning framework for anatomical landmark detection in 3D brain MRI. It requires only **a single annotated reference scan** and uses landmark consistency across subjects to **generalize across unseen MRI contrasts** (e.g., T1w, T2w).

### âœ¨ Key Features

- **Single Reference Annotation**: Reduces annotation effort.
- **Consistency-Based Learning**: Enforces anatomically meaningful landmark protocols.
- **3D Random Convolution for Contrast Augmentation**: Promotes generalization across unseen MRI contrasts.
